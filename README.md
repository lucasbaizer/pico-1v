# Pico 1V

Pico 1V is an RP2040 board with the following additions/changes from the official Raspberry Pi Pico board:

* Switchable 1.8V/3.3V GPIO.
* A power LED.
* A reset button.
* A USB-C port instead of a Micro-B port.

Pico 1V is sill pin-compatible with the official Raspberry Pi Pico board, so you can use Pico 1V as a drop-in replacement for your existing Pico board.
